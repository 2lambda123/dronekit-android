# 3DR Services
**3DR Services** is the implementation of the **DroneAPI** on Android, and is the result of spunning off the backend layer of DroidPlanner 2.

Serving as the new engine for **DroidPlanner 3**, it has also been architectured to act as a platform and backend layer for **any other** Android Ground Control Station, and/or drone related applications.

All the functionality offered by DroidPlanner 2 is now provided as a set of APIs, and easily accessible through a client library, allowing other Android applications to access and leverage the same set of features.

**3DR Services** will be distributed as an apk through the Google Play store, supporting devices running Android 4.0 or higher, making easier for developers to leverage the latest added features through the Google Play store automatic update.
