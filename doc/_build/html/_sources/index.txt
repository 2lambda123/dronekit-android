Welcome to DroneAPI Android's documentation!
============================================

DroneAPI Android provide interfaces for Android applications to control 3DR-powered vehicles. We support planes, copters, multirotors, rovers built using the open-source ArduPilot flight control software. It enables developers to quickly write new applications for vehicles that push the boundaries of autonomous navigation.

3DR Services, the app interface for DroneAPI, which is available on the Google Play store.

DroneAPI is compatible with all ArduCopter and ArduPlane vehicles, which is part of the APM flight controller that powers all 3D Robotics vehicles. `Learn more about Ardupilot <http://ardupilot.com>`_.
