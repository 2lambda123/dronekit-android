Welcome to DroneKit Android's documentation!
============================================

DroneKit Android provides interfaces for Android applications to control 3DR-powered vehicles. We support planes and copters built using the open-source ArduPilot flight control software. DroneKit enables developers to write new applications quickly and easily that push the boundaries of autonomous vehicle navigation.

`3DR Services <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.droidplanner.services.android&hl=en>`_, the guide to drone apps built with DroneKit, is available on the Google Play store.

DroneKit is compatible with all vehicles running ArduCopter or ArduPlane flight code (also known as APM:Copter and APM:Plane). The ArduPilot suite of flight control software powers all 3DR vehicles. `Learn more about ArduPilot here <http://ardupilot.com>`_.
