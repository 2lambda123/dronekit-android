We\r\nsupport planes, copters, multirotors, rovers built using the [open-source ArduPilot](https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot) flight\r\ncontrol software.\r\n\r\n3DR Services enable developers to quickly write new applications for vehicles that push the\r\nboundaries of autonomous navigation.\r\n\r\n### Usage Guide\r\nThe **3DR Services** project is made of two modules:\r\n* [3DR Services App](https://github.com/DroidPlanner/3DRServices/tree/master/ServiceApp):\r\nProvided as an apk through the Google Play store, this is the layer performing direct\r\ncommunication with the 3DR-powered vehicles.\r\n\r\n* [3DR Services Client library](https://github.com/DroidPlanner/3DRServices/tree/master/ClientLib):\r\nClient library used by Android applications to leverage the functionality provided by the 3DR\r\nServices layer.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nList of applications using the 3DR Services APIs:\r\n* [DroidPlanner 3](https://github.com/DroidPlanner/droidplanner)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
